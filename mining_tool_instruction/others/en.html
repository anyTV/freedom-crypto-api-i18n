NiceHash tries to work with many different antivirus companies to whitelist the official NiceHash Miner software. 
Sometimes we still get a false positive and the antivirus software will block the installation or normal operation of the program. 
Please make an exception for the NiceHash Miner installation location in your antivirus software and the program should work without problems. 
If you still experience problems related to antivirus software, please do contact your antivirus provider company.

Users have also reported some issues with ASUS routers. ASUS routers utilize "AiProtection" ("Vulnerability Protection" on older models) to block NiceHash communication with stratum servers. 
If you are using ASUS router and you have issues with timeouts, try to disable ASUS AiProtection.
