<p><strong>Obtaining SeLockMemoryPrivilege failed.</strong></p>
<p>For Windows 7/10 Home:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Download and install&nbsp;Windows <span style="color: #3366ff;">Server 2003 Resource Kit Tools</span>. Ignore any incompatibility warning during installation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open cmd or PowerShell as an administrator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use&nbsp;<code>ntrights -u %USERNAME% +r SeLockMemoryPrivilege</code>&nbsp;where %USERNAME% is the user that will be running the program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reboot.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Warning: Do not download ntrights.exe from any other site other than the offical Microsoft download page.</em></p>
<p><strong>Error msvcp140.dll and vcruntime140.dll not available</strong></p>
<p>Download and install this&nbsp;runtime package&nbsp;from Microsoft.&nbsp;<em>Warning: Do NOT use "missing dll" sites - dll's are exe files with another name, and it is a fairly safe bet that any dll on a shady site like that will be trojaned. Please download offical runtimes from Microsoft above.</em></p>
<p><strong>Error: MEMORY ALLOC FAILED: mmap failed</strong></p>
<p>On Linux you will need to configure large page support and increase your ulimit -l.</p>
<p>To set large page support, add the following lines to&nbsp;<code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code>&nbsp;(<code>/etc/sysctl.d/xmr-stak.conf</code>&nbsp;for&nbsp;Arch Linux&nbsp;and its derivatives):</p>
<pre><code>vm.nr_hugepages=128
</code></pre>
<p>To increase the ulimit, add following lines to&nbsp;<code>/etc/security/limits.conf</code>:</p>
<pre><code>* soft memlock 262144
* hard memlock 262144
</code></pre>
<p>You WILL need to log out and log back in for these settings to take effect on your user (no need to reboot, just relogin in your session).</p>
<p>You can also do it Windows-style and simply run-as-root, but this is NOT recommended for security reasons.</p>
