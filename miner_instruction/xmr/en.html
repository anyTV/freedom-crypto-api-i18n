#### Obtaining SeLockMemoryPrivilege failed.

For Windows 7/10 Home:

1. Download and install Windows Server 2003 Resource Kit Tools. Ignore any incompatibility warning during installation.

2. Open cmd or PowerShell as an administrator.

3. Use ntrights -u %USERNAME% +r SeLockMemoryPrivilege where %USERNAME% is the user that will be running the program.

4. Reboot.

*Warning: Do not download ntrights.exe from any other site other than the offical Microsoft download page.*

**Error msvcp140.dll and vcruntime140.dll not available**

Download and install this runtime package from Microsoft. Warning: Do NOT use "missing dll" sites - dll's are exe files with another name, and it is a fairly safe bet that any dll on a shady site like that will be trojaned. Please download offical runtimes from Microsoft above.

**Error: MEMORY ALLOC FAILED: mmap failed**

On Linux you will need to configure large page support and increase your ulimit -l.

To set large page support, add the following lines to /etc/sysctl.conf (/etc/sysctl.d/xmr-stak.conf for Arch Linux and its derivatives):

          vm.nr_hugepages=128
To increase the ulimit, add following lines to /etc/security/limits.conf:

* soft memlock 262144
* hard memlock 262144
You WILL need to log out and log back in for these settings to take effect on your user (no need to reboot, just relogin in your session).

You can also do it Windows-style and simply run-as-root, but this is NOT recommended for security reasons.
